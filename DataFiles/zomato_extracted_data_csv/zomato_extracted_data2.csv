The best thing I liked is the staff and service. Extremely qualified, courteous and dressed in theme. Very good variety in food. The starters especially seafood was cooked very well. The options for veg can be improved though. Main course options blew my mind. Great effort by the whole team. Chaat counter is the best I have ever seen.

May be because of the location. You will have to take time to figure out where is what. Taste wise it's different from the other center.Hospitality also is not as exceptional like the other one.Overall as we had the same expectation like it's other branch we got disappointed but for first timers it's a good place to visit and have fun.""], ['2019-10-07 13:29:24', 'positive', 'NA', ""Black pearl is one of the most classes buffer location in Bangalore got great range of starters both veg and non veg....
